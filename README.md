## Project Description
This project involves building an automated watering vehicle using an Arduino board to control various aspects of the vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a water tank and sensors to detect soil moisture levels. When the soil is detected to be dry, the vehicle moves to the plant location and dispenses the necessary amount of water.
